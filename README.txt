Decryption of Beale cipher(paper 2)

History
The Beale ciphers (or Beale Papers) are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US$43 million as of January 2018.
The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared.
However, one of them was decrypted to find out first paper consists of the exact location, second one(decrypted one) decribes the value of treasure and third one tells about the rightful heir of the treasure.
